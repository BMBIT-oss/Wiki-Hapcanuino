You can use [Hapcan programmer](http://hapcan.com/software/hap/) software to set some parameters of Hapcanuino device, but because of Arduino's architecture, not all features are available. **Hapcan programmer** don't know Your device, so it can't control it directly (You can still send direct commands to Your device using), it can't display any specific window for configure Your device either. (Solution for that will be available in a while).
