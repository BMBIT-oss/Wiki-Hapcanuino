## Description
This example shows the basics of Hapcanuino library usage. Without writing single line of code, Hapcanuino should be visible by [Hapcan programmer](http://hapcan.com/software/hap/) software already.

Hello World device can perform only one instruction, toggle LED connected to Arduino's port.

## Required hardware
For base required hardware see [Hardware requirements](https://github.com/Onixarts/Hapcanuino/wiki/Hardware-requirements)

- Connected LED with 1kOhm resistor to PIN7 and GND of Arduino Uno.

## Basic setup
After proper MCP CAN module connection to Arduino board and Hapcan bus, load the Sketch into Arduino.
